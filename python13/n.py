#The output of 5 is because the for loop iterates through the list [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] and increments the value of tot by 1 on each iteration. Since there are 5 elements in the list, the value of tot is 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 5 after the loop has finished iterating.

#Here is the step-by-step explanation of how the code works:

#The variable tot is initialized to 0.
#The for loop iterates through the list [5, 4, 3, 2, 1].
#On each iteration, the value of i is assigned to the current element in the list.
#The value of tot is incremented by 1.
#The loop continues until all elements in  best list have been iterated through.
#The value of tot is printed, which is 5.
